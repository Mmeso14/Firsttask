so i'm beginning to enjoy programming class, what seemed hard at first is actually fun, guess it boils down to faith and cvercoming the initial fear that comes along with trying out something new. i'm also grateful to my coach.
This is my first programming assignment and i kinda like it and i look forward to more projects and probaby make a hobby out of it.
