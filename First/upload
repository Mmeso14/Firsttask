This is the official assignment, i'm trying to create a file from git and then sync it to my local machine.
My coach is doing a great job i must confess, i had this phobia towards programming initially seeing the numbers and the digits involved or perhaps it's because we,ve not gotten there yet.
Faith and overcoming fear shaa has a part to play in all this though.
